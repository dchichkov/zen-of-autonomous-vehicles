The Zen of Autonomous Vehicles

===========================  
Dense is better than sparse.  
There should be one calibrated timestamp.  
Past, present and future is ground truth.  
Calibration is essential to it.  
Difficult case is one architecture guide.  
The answer is deep learning.  
Embeddings are important.  
Newton is nearly always right.  
In the face of uncertainty, keep track of it.  
Computation graph is one obvious way to do it.  
Every line of code is a constraint working against you.  
Special cases are not special enough to break the rules.  
Railways require active avoidance.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --performance metric.  
Normalized to target domain.  
Some of the requirements are known.
Pedestrians who don't break eye contact go in the training set.
It is as good as your data.  
Virtual reality maps are essential.  
Simulators are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!  
It is a safety problem.
